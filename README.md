# Coding Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to two coding exercises given as part of the Software Engineer interview process. 

The repository is structured as follows:

- `exercise1/`: This directory contains the solution to the first exercise, which involves finding duplicate elements in a list. The solution is written in Python and does not depend on any third-party libraries. It also contains a `test_exercise1.py` script containing various test cases to validate the function. 

- `exercise2/`: This directory contains the solution to the second exercise, which involves reading a JSON file, traversing the dependencies of packages, and reconstructing the full dependency graph. The solution also includes test cases for validating the function that constructs the graph.

Each directory contains its own `README.md` file with more detailed information about the specific exercise and the solution. Please refer to these files for more details.
