# Coding Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to two coding exercises given as part of an interview process. 

The repository is structured as follows:

- `exercise1/`: This directory contains the solution to the first exercise, which involves finding duplicate elements in a list. The solution is written in Python and does not depend on any third-party libraries.

- `exercise2/`: This directory contains the solution to the second exercise, which involves reading a JSON file, traversing the dependencies of packages, and reconstructing the full dependency graph. The solution also includes a test cases for validating the function that constructs the graph.

Each directory contains its own `README.md` file with more detailed information about the specific exercise and the solution. Please refer to these files for more details.
